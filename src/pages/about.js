      <h1>Hi there,</h1>
      <p>
        My name is Sooji and I'm a jack of all trades. I do some design and
        full-stack development work at Intuit. I'm passionate about making
        websites that are easy to use and friendly.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my free time, I might be found making mechanical keyboards, embroidering,
        cooking hearty meals, and playing fetch with my dog Crouton.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can find me on... places!
